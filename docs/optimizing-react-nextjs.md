# React 19

**New React Compiler:** React 19 introduces a new _React Compiler_ that automatically optimizes your code for
performance. The compiler applies the equivalent of manual memoization throughout your component
tree, so that “only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes,” a style sometimes called “fine-
grained reactivity”. In practice, this means React 19 will detect when a component’s output does not
depend on changing state and reuse the previous render, avoiding costly reconciliations. For example, if a
child component renders the same output despite a parent’s state change, the compiler will skip re-
rendering it. Similarly, expensive hook calculations (like calling a heavy function inside a render) can be
memoized automatically by the compiler. The net effect is fewer unnecessary re-renders and smaller
overall bundle sizes. (In fact, early reports indicate auto memoization and dead-code elimination can shrink
bundles by tens of percent.) To try the compiler today, install the babel-plugin-react-compiler and
the new ESLint rule – React’s docs include a [setup guide][12] and emphasize that even React 17/18 apps
can use it via the react-compiler-runtime package.

```
// Example (conceptual): With React Compiler, this computation might be memoized
automatically
functionDashboard({ items }) {
consttotal= items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0);
return<div>Total: {total}</div>;
}
```
**use Hook (Async & Suspense):** React 19 adds a new built-in hook use(resource), which lets you
“suspend” on Promises directly inside components. When you pass a Promise (e.g. from a fetch) to use ,
React 19 will pause rendering until the Promise resolves, and then continue with the resolved value.
This integrates seamlessly with <Suspense> and error boundaries: while the Promise is pending, any
ancestor <Suspense fallback=...> will display its fallback UI; if the Promise rejects, the nearest error
boundary catches it. In effect, use() removes the boilerplate of managing loading/error state yourself.
For example, a client component might look like:

```
import { Suspense, use} from'react';
```
```
functionPostsList({ postsPromise}) {
constposts= use(postsPromise);// Suspends until `postsPromise` resolves
return(
<ul>
{posts.map(post=> <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)}
</ul>
);
}
```
```
1
```
```
2
```
```
3 1
```
```
4
```

```
// Somewhere higher in the tree:
<Suspensefallback={<div>Loadingposts...</div>}>
<PostsListpostsPromise={fetch('/api/posts').then(res=> res.json())}/>
</Suspense>
```
This pattern means you no longer need useState/useEffect for basic async data. (React’s docs
caution that for _server_ components you might still use await instead of use(), but for client
components use() is a powerful new option .) Notably, Next.js 15 supports this out of the box: e.g. a
client component in Next can do const allPosts = use(posts) where posts is a Promise passed
from a parent; the UI will suspend appropriately. The result is simpler code and built-in streaming of
data through Suspense.

**Memoization Techniques:** Traditionally, React apps used hooks like useMemo and useCallback to
cache expensive values or callbacks and avoid unnecessary work. Those are still available, but React 19’s
compiler reduces the need for most manual memoization. In fact, the compiler often auto-memoizes
component render outputs and hook return values, making many useMemo/useCallback calls
superfluous. You should still use them in specific cases: e.g., if you have a function or calculation
that’s shared across components and truly expensive, useMemo can prevent recomputing it per render.
Likewise, wrap stable child callbacks in useCallback to keep referential identity. Also consider
React.memo(Component) for pure functional components to skip re-renders when props haven’t
changed. But be aware: in React 19, overusing useMemo can even hurt performance because of added
complexity. In practice, rely on the compiler’s auto-memoization and reserve manual memo for cases
the compiler can’t detect (like memoizing values used across multiple components). Always profile before
adding useMemo – the compiler may already have optimized it.

**Concurrent Rendering & Large Trees:** React 19 fully embraces concurrent rendering (continuing the
model from React 18). In fact, concurrency is on by default in React 19, meaning React can interrupt, split,
and prioritize updates without blocking the main thread. This lets very large or complex UIs remain
responsive: for example, you can use useTransition to defer non-urgent updates (like rendering a
heavy list) so that high-priority interactions (like typing in an input) aren’t janky. React 19 also
further optimizes reconciliation: the diffing algorithm has been tuned so that rendering deeply nested trees
is noticeably faster. According to early benchmarks, “internal optimizations reduce memory usage and
improve rendering performance, particularly for large component trees”. In practical terms, structure
your UI so expensive subtrees can yield to interrupts (e.g. wrap them in <Suspense> or mark updates
with startTransition). Virtualize or paginate huge lists as needed. But thanks to these improvements,
even apps with thousands of nodes should see smoother updates.

**Fast Hydration & Minimal Re-renders:** Hydration (attaching React to SSR HTML) is a critical step for
performance. React 19 adds smarter hydration logic to minimize wasted renders. Notably, if third-party
scripts or browser extensions have injected extra DOM nodes, React will _skip_ unexpected tags instead of
treating them as mismatches. This avoids forcing a full re-render of the entire app due to minor DOM
differences. Also, React 19 provides new resource-preloading APIs to speed up hydration: for example, you
can call preload(url, {as:'style'}) or prefetchDNS(url) inside components (server- or client-
side) and React will emit <link rel="preload"> or <link rel="dns-prefetch"> in the HTML.
Use these to hint browsers to load critical scripts, fonts, or data early. Together, these features mean your

app will hydrate with fewer interruptions: unnecessary re-renders are avoided, and important resources
start fetching early, reducing time-to-interactive.

## Next.js 15

### Server Actions (Async Mutations):

Next.js 15 supports **Server Actions** , a new way to run server-side code from React components (introduced
by React 19). A server action is simply an async function marked with a "use server" directive; it’s
compiled into a server-only endpoint. You can invoke a server action from a form or event handler in a
Client Component. For example:

```
// app/actions.js
'use server';
export asyncfunction createUser(data) {
// Perform database mutation or API call here
// e.g. await db.users.create(data);
// Optionally revalidate cache:
// import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'; revalidatePath('/users');
}
```
In a client component, you would use it like:

```
'use client';
import { createUser} from'@/app/actions';
```
```
export defaultfunctionSignupForm() {
return(
<form action={createUser}>
<input name="email"type="email"required />
<buttontype="submit">SignUp</button>
</form>
);
}
```
By default, every call to a server action incurs a round-trip to the Next.js server (so treat them like HTTP
requests). In exchange, you get simpler code (no separate API route) and automatic security by design.
Next.js performs _dead code elimination_ on actions: any exported action function that isn’t actually used will
be stripped out and _not_ exposed to the client bundle. This keeps your client bundle lean. Moreover,
Next.js now generates _unguessable action IDs_ under the hood, so clients can call them securely without
exposing implementation details. In practice, limit the number of server actions you call per page:
grouping logic in a single action (or batching mutations) can avoid extra latency. Use useFormStatus()
or useActionState() (from React 19’s helpers) to show pending indicators while an action runs. You
can also use optimistic UI updates with useOptimistic() for better UX. Overall, server actions
typically improve performance by eliminating API-route boilerplate and by co-locating data mutations, but

```

```

```
```

```

remember each action is an async round-trip; for very high-frequency events, a traditional in-browser
approach or API route might sometimes be more efficient.

### Middleware (Routing & Auth at the Edge):

Next.js 15’s middleware runs _at the edge by default_ , giving you global, low-latency routing and auth logic

. A single middleware.ts file at the project root can examine incoming requests and rewrite/redirect
as needed. **Best practices:** only run middleware on the routes you need by using matchers (in
config.matcher) – by default middleware fires on _every_ request, so scoping it reduces overhead. Keep
middleware code **lightweight and fast** : it runs on every matched request, so avoid heavy I/O or slow loops
. For example, a simple auth check might look like:

```
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse}from'next/server';
```
```
export functionmiddleware(request) {
consttoken= request.cookies.get('auth-token');
if(!token) {
// Redirect to login if not authenticated
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
}
returnNextResponse.next(); // proceed normally
}
```
```
export constconfig = {
matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/settings/:path*'],// only run on these paths
};
```
Note that middleware runs on the Edge runtime, so it has access only to Web APIs (no arbitrary Node
modules). This constraint ensures **high performance and scalability** – edge functions start instantly and
run globally close to users. Use NextResponse.next(), .redirect(), or .rewrite() to control the
flow. On Vercel, middleware benefits from the Edge network for near-instant responses, making things like
auth checks and A/B tests very fast. Remember: place only routing/auth logic in middleware; anything
requiring heavy computation or long-lived DB calls belongs in API routes or server actions.

### Edge Rendering vs. Server Rendering:

Next.js 15 lets you choose where code runs: on the Node.js server (the default) or on the Edge. Use the Edge
Runtime (export const config = { runtime: 'edge' }) for endpoints or pages that need **ultra-
low latency** and minimal startup time. Edge is ideal for simple logic (e.g. personalization, small data
lookups, header-based decisions) because it “can deliver dynamic content at low latency with small, simple
functions”. By contrast, the Node.js runtime supports all npm libraries and heavier tasks but has higher
cold-start latency (~250ms or more, vs. _instant_ for Edge ). In practice, default to Node.js for complex SSR
that uses many libraries (databases, heavy computation), and use Edge for very fast global responses (e.g.
internationalized content, or highly cached pages). On Vercel, remember that Node functions run in AWS
Lambda-style containers (“Serverless”) which can take time to spin up if idle, whereas Edge Functions run

immediately on Vercel’s CDN. If a page can be fully statically pre-rendered (SSG) at build time, that is fastest
(served directly from CDN). If not, prefer **incremental static regeneration (ISR)** or Edge SSR to minimize
wait. For example, mark pages that use dynamic data with export const revalidate = 10; to have
Vercel cache them and refresh in the background. Use streaming SSR (React 18+) or partial rendering to
send a loading shell first and hydrate progressively – Next.js 15’s App Router supports streaming by default
for async Server Components. The choice of Edge vs Server runtime and pre-rendering strategy should be
guided by profiling: if you need global low latency, lean toward Edge; if you need heavy I/O, stick with
Node.js.

### General Optimization Practices:

```
Image Optimization: Use Next.js’s built-in <Image> component. It automatically serves optimally
sized images with modern formats, and lazy-loads them by default. Mark above-the-fold images with
priority={true} (or loading="eager") to preload them. Don’t forget to specify width/
height or sizes so Next.js can generate appropriate srcset. On Vercel, image requests
will hit the Vercel Image CDN for on-the-fly optimization, speeding up load times.
Code-Splitting & Lazy Loading: Dynamically import heavy components so they don’t bloat the initial
bundle. For example:
```
```
import dynamicfrom'next/dynamic';
constChart = dynamic(() =>import('./ChartComponent'), {
loading: () => <p>Loading chart...</p>
});
```
```
This defers loading the ChartComponent until it’s needed, reducing the JavaScript on the initial
load. Do similarly for large libraries or offscreen widgets.
Static Assets & Caching: Serve unchanged files (images, fonts, JSON) from the /public directory;
Next.js and Vercel will apply far-future cache headers. For API data or pages that can be cached, use
ISR with appropriate revalidate. Leverage HTTP caching headers (e.g. Cache-Control:
public, max-age=3600) on JSON routes if your data isn’t changing rapidly. Prefetch key
resources: for example, use React 19’s preload()/prefetchDNS() APIs to hint at critical scripts
or fonts early , or include <link rel="preload"> in custom <Head>.
Minimize Re-renders on Client: Use React’s production build and enable compiler optimizations
(NODE_ENV=production). Keep component state minimal and avoid anonymous functions/objects
as props (use useCallback or useMemo if a function must be regenerated). The React Compiler
in 19 will handle most memoization, but you can still help by writing pure components and following
the [Rules of React] (e.g. don’t mutate props). Employ React.memo for high-level components that
receive the same props often.
Developer Experience (DX) on Vercel: Take advantage of Vercel’s platform integrations. Every git
push gives a preview deployment to test performance before production. Vercel Analytics can
measure real-world metrics (TTFB, LCP, etc.). Use Vercel’s build caching and Turbopack to speed up
rebuilds. Deploying on Vercel means static pages and assets land on a global CDN automatically;
leverage this by pre-rendering as much as possible. Also, the Next.js 15 defaults (Edge functions,
automatic image CDN, etc.) are tuned for Vercel’s architecture, so adopt Vercel-specific config like
vercel.json redirects, or serverComponents caching hints, to further optimize. In summary:
combine React 19’s compiler and Suspense patterns with Next.js’s data fetching and edge

capabilities – this hybrid approach (static + streaming SSR + incremental) yields the best
performance.
