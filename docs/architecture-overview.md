# Designing an MVP Web App for Automation ROI

# Calculation

## User Persona & Goals

Operations managers, automation consultants, and tech-savvy freelancers like persona _Michael Chen_ need
to **justify the ROI of automation projects quickly and clearly**. Their goal is to demonstrate time saved,
cost savings, and business value to stakeholders without cumbersome spreadsheets or guesswork. The
MVP should therefore make ROI highly transparent, using an **interactive approach** that adapts to user
inputs and provides immediate feedback.

## Overall Structure & Pages

The application will guide the user through three main stages:

```
AI-Powered ROI Questionnaire (Landing Page) – A minimalistic, creative welcome page featuring a
conversational AI that asks the user key questions about an automation workflow (following the ROI
framework T, H, V*, R, U, C ).
Visual Workflow Builder Canvas (Second Page) – A sandbox where users can visually construct or
import an automation workflow, using node-based diagrams (in a fun, retro “RPG-style” pixelated
theme).
Modular ROI Dashboard (Main Page) – A Notion-inspired dashboard displaying ROI metrics in
movable, resizable modules. Users can personalize this page by adding, removing, or rearranging
modules like Time Savings, Revenue Uplift, Costs, etc., and even get AI-driven insights.
```
Each stage flows into the next, creating a guided experience from initial input to workflow design to results.
Below, we detail UI/UX ideas, architectural patterns, and smart AI techniques for each part.

## 1. Conversational ROI Questionnaire (Landing Page)

The first page centers on an **AI-driven chat interface** that gathers input for the ROI formula in a
conversational manner. Instead of a static form, an AI assistant greets the user and asks one question at a
time in natural language (making the experience feel more like a dialogue than data entry). This draws
inspiration from emerging “conversational form” trends, where a chatbot-style UI helps fill out forms.

**Key ROI Inputs (T, H, V*, R, U, C):** The AI will sequentially cover:

```
T (Time Saved per Month): The assistant might start with questions like “What process are you
automating, and how often does it run?”. Based on the answer, it asks “Roughly how long does this task
take a person manually?”. The user’s answers (e.g. runs per month and minutes per run ) determine
the time saved per month. The UI could provide helpful context like industry benchmarks: e.g.
```
### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

```

```

```

```

```
“Invoice data entry typically takes ~4 minutes each” to guide user estimates. These prompts make it
easy for users to provide accurate data, or adjust defaults if needed.
```
```
H (Hourly Wage): Next, the chatbot can say, “To quantify time savings, what’s the average hourly rate of
the person doing this task?”. An input box is pre-filled with a reasonable default (say $30/hr ), which
the user can override. There could also be a dropdown to select a role (Admin, Sales, etc.), auto-
filling with a typical market rate. The AI might clarify if needed: “Is $30/hour about right for this role at
your company?”. This keeps the flow quick while allowing customization.
```
```
V* (Task Value Multiplier): This multiplier represents how valuable the task is relative to pure time
costs. The UI can present a couple of dropdowns: e.g. “Select task type” (each type has a base value
factor) and “Business size/impact” (solo, small team, enterprise – affecting the multiplier). For
example, a critical task in a growing business might get a higher multiplier. The AI can assist by
interpreting the workflow description to suggest a multiplier. Later on, the AI could infer this
automatically ; for MVP, we might use simple presets. This V* accounts for qualitative benefits
(e.g. tasks affecting many people or high importance get a higher value factor).
```
```
R (Risk/Compliance Value): If the workflow reduces errors or compliance risks, the user can toggle
a Risk question. Upon toggling “Yes, this reduces a compliance risk,” additional inputs appear (e.g.
estimated error rate, severity of each error in $$, etc. ). We can use sliders or small numeric inputs for
“Risk level (1-5)” and “Estimated cost of one error.” The AI could ask something like, “Do errors in this
process lead to any financial penalties or rework costs?”. If unsure, the assistant can suggest profiles:
“For a finance task, errors might cost ~$100 each on average – does that sound right?” (drawing on
industry knowledge). This helps quantify risk reduction value in dollars. If risk isn’t applicable,
this section is skipped to keep the conversation concise.
```
```
U (Revenue Uplift): For automations that drive revenue (e.g. lead generation or sales outreach), the
AI asks if the workflow impacts revenue. If yes, a brief sub-conversation collects: “How many leads (or
transactions) per month could this generate?”, “What is the conversion rate to sale?”, “What’s the average
value per conversion?”. These three inputs let the app estimate new revenue gained per month from
the automation. We can show default values or ranges for guidance (e.g. average conversion rates in
similar contexts). For instance, the AI might prompt: “Let’s estimate revenue: if you get 100 extra
leads at a 5% conversion and each sale is $500, that’s $2,500 uplift. What numbers fit your case?”. This
conversational approach helps users who may not initially know these values arrive at reasonable
estimates with AI help.
```
```
C (Automation Cost): Finally, the AI inquires about the cost of running the automation. In an MVP
with no live integration, we default to known pricing models. The UI might auto-fill some cost
assumptions based on chosen tools (e.g. “Using Zapier on a Team plan ~$20/mo” or “Each AI call costs
~$0.002; with your volume that’s $5/mo” ). The user can manually override these or break them down if
desired (e.g. “Zapier $20, OpenAI $5”). For now, we rely on standard pricing info rather than
dynamic lookup. The AI could confirm: “We’ve estimated about $25/month for automation tools – sound
okay?”. This ensures cost is accounted for in ROI.
```
Throughout this Q&A, the **tone remains conversational and helpful**. The page design is clean and
minimalistic – perhaps just a chat bubble interface in the center of an uncluttered page, with an AI avatar
(maybe a friendly pixel-art robot or mascot to add creativity) and a text input for the user. Progress

indicators (like subtle dots or a step count) can reassure the user of how many questions remain. Each
answer updates the underlying ROI calculations in the background.

**AI Assistance & Smart Defaults:** The Azure OpenAI-powered agent dynamically adjusts to user input. For
example, if a user says _“I’m not sure how long it takes”_ for a task, the agent can reply with a sensible guess:
_“No worries – similar tasks usually take 5-10 minutes. Let’s use 8 minutes for now (you can adjust later).”_ This
leverages the AI’s training on general knowledge and any built-in heuristics. Similarly, if the user enters an
unusually high number, the AI might double-check: _“That’s quite a lot – did you mean 500 runs per month
(about 25 per workday)? Just making sure!”_. These gentle validations improve data quality. This approach is
inspired by forms that **use AI to guide accurate inputs** , reducing user effort.

By the end of this chat, the app has all needed inputs to calculate ROI: Time saved (T _H_ V _), risk value, revenue
value, and cost. The AI can then transition the user to the next step with a summary. For example,_ “Great! It looks
like this automation could save about 33 hours/month and generate ~$2.5K in value. Now, shall we map out
the workflow itself? I can take you to a canvas where we visualize the automation.”* A “Continue” button or
a natural language prompt (like “Yes, let’s see it”) can lead into the second page.

## 2. Visual Workflow Builder Canvas (Automation Canvas)

The second page is all about **building or importing the automation workflow** in a visual, intuitive way.
Here we draw heavy UI/UX inspiration from top automation platforms:

```
Zapier’s Visual Editor: Zapier recently introduced a flowchart-like editor where instead of a linear
list, you see a diagram of connected steps. This makes complex branched logic easier to grasp at
a glance. Our canvas will similarly show triggers and actions as connected nodes. In Zapier’s case,
each step is a box and paths (like “if yes do X, if no do Y”) are visible branches. We aim for a
similar clarity: the user should be able to see every step and branch of their automation without
digging into menus.
```
```
Make.com (formerly Integromat): Make uses a graphical node interface where modules (apps/
actions) are circular icons connected by lines, giving a clear visual sequence. It emphasizes drag-and-
drop building and visual monitoring of data flow. Make’s design is known for being user-friendly and
modern after its rebrand. We’ll incorporate the drag-and-drop node paradigm : users can
drag an app or action from a side panel onto the canvas, then draw connections between nodes to
set the flow.
```
```
n8n (Open Source): n8n offers a canvas with nodes representing different apps or functions, which
users can freely arrange. We can leverage open-source libraries (like React Flow or similar )
to implement this node editor efficiently. The canvas will support features like zooming, panning,
and maybe a mini-map for larger workflows.
```
**RPG-Style Pixelated Theme:** To give our product a unique personality at MVP stage, the nodes and
graphics will have a playful **8-bit pixel art style**. For example, each app or action node could be represented
by a pixelated icon (imagine a tiny pixel robot for an AI step, or a pixel mail envelope for an email step). The
connections could be simple colored lines (possibly with a retro dashed style or arrowheads that resemble
classic game UI). This aesthetic choice not only differentiates the look from competitors’ sleek modern UIs,

```

```

but also resonates with the theme of “gamifying” workflow building. It subtly frames automation as a fun
quest or puzzle: _you’re linking nodes like a retro adventure map_. Importantly, we will ensure usability isn’t
compromised – the icons should remain clear and the text (node labels, etc.) legible. Pixel art can be used
for cosmetic flair (borders, background grid, icons) without making the text or connectors hard to see.

_Example of a node-based workflow builder interface (from an n8n workflow). In our app, a similar canvas will let
users drag nodes (triggers/actions) and connect them to design automation flows. A retro pixel-art style can be
applied to nodes and icons to give a unique visual identity._

Each node on our canvas will typically display an icon or label for the app/service and a brief description of
the action (e.g. **Gmail – Send Email** , **Salesforce – Create Lead** ). Nodes can be color-coded by type (trigger,
action, AI step, etc.) to help visual parsing. Connections are drawn to indicate data or execution flow. The
leftmost node might be a **Trigger** (the event that starts the automation), and subsequent nodes to the right
are actions. Branching logic (like IF conditions) could be handled by special decision nodes or by allowing
multiple outputs from a node (similar to Zapier’s Paths or n8n’s conditional nodes). For MVP, we might
simplify and allow linear flows and basic branching, deferring more complex loop/merge logic.

**Importing Prebuilt Automations:** Not every user will want to start from scratch. We plan to include a
library of common automation templates that can be imported with one click. For example, a user could
choose a template like “New invoice -> extract data -> add to QuickBooks” or “New lead -> send follow-up
email -> Slack notification”. When selected, the canvas is automatically populated with the sequence of
nodes for that workflow. The user can then adjust or personalize it. If the user came from the questionnaire,
we could even suggest templates based on their inputs. For instance, if they indicated the task type was
“Invoice Extraction & Entry” during the Q&A, the app could recommend loading a relevant template
workflow (e.g., a Make/Zapier style invoice processing flow). This accelerates setup and helps non-technical
users visualize their scenario. _(In the ROI case studies provided, examples like “Invoice Extraction & Entry (Make
or Zapier)” and other domain-specific automations could serve as templates.)_

We also aim to allow **import from integration metadata** of external tools (Zapier/Make/n8n) – for
instance, if the user has an existing Zap in Zapier, they could upload or paste its structure (if available via
export or through an API). However, since our MVP has no backend and limited scope, this might be


aspirational. Instead, we focus on template imports and manual creation. Still, designing the architecture
with import in mind is wise for future expansion.

**Building from Scratch (Drag & Drop):** Users who choose to create a workflow from scratch will have a
**toolbox panel** (typically on the left side of the screen) listing available apps/integrations. A search bar at the
top of this panel lets them filter quickly (type “Google” to see Google Sheets, Gmail, etc.). They can drag an
app into the canvas which prompts them to select a specific trigger/action of that app. For example,
dragging “Google Sheets” might pop up options: _“New Spreadsheet Row (Trigger)” or “Add Row (Action)”_. Once
placed, the node can be connected to others. We should allow connecting outputs to inputs by dragging
from one node’s port to another, a familiar interaction in node editors.

To maintain our theme, the UI might include subtle retro touches: for instance, when dragging a node, it
could show a ghost image in pixelated form; or the background grid could be reminiscent of old RPG maps
(light grid with maybe faint “terrain” patterns). These should be cosmetic – the core interaction remains
modern HTML5 drag-and-drop with smooth feedback (highlighting connection targets, etc.).

**Node Configuration:** Clicking a node typically should open a details panel (perhaps on the right side)
where the user can configure that step (e.g., mapping fields, adding static text, etc.). Given no live
connections in MVP, we can simulate this by letting users fill in dummy fields or notes. However, since our
focus is ROI rather than execution, we might not need deep configuration at MVP. It could suffice to let
users label the node or note what it does (for visual clarity). The presence of certain nodes could feed back
into ROI suggestions (for example, if the user places an “OpenAI – GPT-4” node, the system knows there will
be an OpenAI API cost and can factor a default cost per call into the C value; or if they add multiple steps,
maybe it implies more time saved, etc.). This integration between the canvas and ROI calculations via AI
could be a powerful differentiator: the system can **infer some ROI inputs from the workflow structure**.
For instance, the app could count how many steps or what types of tasks are automated and have the AI
suggest _“With 5 automated steps, you’re eliminating quite a few manual touchpoints – your time savings might
be higher than initially estimated.”_ (We will ensure such suggestions are subtle and only to assist, not to
override user inputs.)

**Comparison to Competitors:** Where competitors like Zapier historically had a very linear UI, they moved to
visual flows for clarity. We combine that clarity with a creative twist (pixel art style) to stand out. Open-
source n8n’s canvas has proven that even complex workflows can be managed with a node UI; our app can
achieve similar power but targeted specifically at ROI-aware automation building. The **unique value** here is
tying the visual builder directly into ROI measurement – competitors don’t typically overlay ROI info onto
the builder. In our app, a user could, say, click on a node and see how much value that step contributes
(e.g., _this automated email saves 2 hours/month_ ), making ROI tangible at each part of the process. That could
be a future feature, but it’s a vision to guide our design thinking.

Finally, once the user has built or imported a workflow and is satisfied (even at a rough outline level), they
can proceed to the ROI Dashboard to see the quantitative results. A “Next: See ROI Summary” button could
appear after the canvas has at least one node connected (with a pulse animation to draw attention). The
transition to page 3 might involve packaging the collected data (ROI inputs + the workflow structure) to
feed the dashboard.

## 3. Notion-Inspired Modular ROI Dashboard (Results Page)

The third page is the culmination: a **dashboard of ROI metrics and insights**. We want this page to be
highly flexible, letting users focus on what matters to them and present the results in a client-friendly
manner. The design takes inspiration from **Notion’s modular, block-based pages** , where content can be
rearranged and resized freely to create a custom layout. As one source puts it, a Notion dashboard is like
_“having a personal assistant, ready to present your most crucial information in a visually appealing and easily
accessible format... a flexible solution”_. We aim to provide that feeling for automation ROI data.

**Layout & Modules:** The dashboard will consist of various **modules (widgets)** that the user can add or
remove. Each module is essentially a content block containing a specific ROI-related visualization or metric.
Examples of modules we’ll include:

```
Time Savings Value – displays the calculated hours saved per month and its dollar value (T × H × V ).
This could be shown as a big number (e.g. “33.3 hours/month saved = $2,100/month value” with T, H, V
factors listed in small text). Maybe a small icon of a clock or hourglass emphasizes the time aspect.
Revenue Uplift – shows the extra revenue per month from the automation (if any) and key inputs
(volume, conversion, value per conversion). Could use an icon like a rising graph or dollar sign.
Risk Reduction – if R was provided, this module highlights the risk value. Possibly show something
like “Errors prevented per month: X, Est. savings: $Y”. If not applicable, the user might not include
this module.
Automation Cost – lists the monthly cost of the automation (and possibly a breakdown by tool, e.g.
Zapier $20, OpenAI $5). Might display as a negative value (outflow) for clarity.
Net ROI – the overall net benefit per month (Total Value – Cost) and an ROI multiple or percentage.
For example, “Net ROI: $2,060 per month ” and “ROI Ratio: 6700× ” (like in the case study calculation,
which yielded ~6701× return ). This could be styled boldly since it’s the bottom line number many
will look for.
Payback Period – optionally, how long to recoup any one-time investment (if we consider one-time
setup cost; for MVP we mostly focus on monthly ROI, but if needed, we can allow the user to input
one-time implementation effort and then compute payback time).
Summary/Report – a text block (possibly AI-generated) that narratively summarizes the ROI: e.g.,
“This automation saves ~33 hours of work monthly (worth ~$2.1K), and brings in an estimated $240K in
annual revenue uplift, at a cost of just ~$36. Your return on investment is astronomical – over 6700×!
This means the automation pays for itself in less than a day.” Such a summary, generated by the AI
from the numbers, can be a highlight that users might copy to share with others. This module would
leverage the AI agent to turn raw numbers into an executive-friendly paragraph.
```
The layout will allow these modules to be arranged in one or multiple columns. For example, a user might
have Time Savings and Revenue side by side at the top, with Net ROI big below them. We can provide a
default layout but let the user personalize it. Using an approach similar to drag-and-drop of blocks (like
Notion), the user could drag a module’s “handle” to reorder it or drag it next to another to form a column.
Achieving true freeform drag-and-drop in a web app can be complex, but libraries like React Grid Layout or
just CSS grid with draggable items could be used. Since we’re using **shadcn/ui (a component library)** and
Tailwind CSS, we can likely style these modules as cards that are grid-aware.

At MVP, if full drag-and-drop is too much, we could allow a simpler customization: e.g. a toggle between
“single column” vs “two-column” view and arrows to move modules up/down. However, given the emphasis
on a Notion-like feel, investing in a bit of client-side drag/drop for a wow factor might be worth it.

Each module will have a header (title) and the content (number, chart, text, etc.). Modules should be
collapsible – e.g., a small “hide” button that minimizes the module to just its header. This way a user can
declutter the view if certain metrics are not of interest at the moment. They might even remove a module
entirely via a close [X] button (with the option to re-add from an “Add Widget” menu). This is analogous to
adding or removing blocks in a dashboard application.

**Visual Enhancements:** We can use simple charts for some modules if it adds value – for example, a small
bar or pie chart comparing _time saved vs time spent_ , or a trendline if we project ROI over a year. Given MVP
scope and no historical data, charts are optional. A simple but effective visual might be an icon or
illustration per module to make it more engaging (e.g., a little pixel trophy for Net ROI, a shield for Risk
reduction, etc., keeping with the slight gamification theme).

The color scheme should remain professional (since ops managers will present this to leadership) yet
modern. Perhaps a dark mode style dashboard with vibrant accent colors for the numbers, or a light
minimal style with pastel highlights. We can take cues from Notion’s clean aesthetic: lots of whitespace,
subtle dividers, and gentle typography – then layer our own brand style on it (maybe a fixed subtle
background pattern that echoes the pixel art theme without distracting).

**AI Agents & Insights:** A standout feature on this page will be built-in **AI assistance for analysis and
recommendations**. Here’s how that could manifest:

```
An “Insights” sidebar or section where a basic AI agent comments on the ROI findings. For
instance, it might highlight: “Your ROI is extremely high – this is a huge win! The time savings alone (
hours/month) mean one full work-week freed up every month. You could reallocate that time to other
projects.” Or if the ROI is marginal, it might say: “Net ROI is modest. Consider increasing the runs per
month or using a cheaper tool to improve ROI.” These insights would come from prompting the AI with
the calculated results and perhaps the workflow description. Essentially, the AI serves as a virtual
analyst pointing out notable points in the data.
```
```
“What-If Scenarios”: Although more advanced, we could allow the user to ask the AI questions in a
chat-like interface on the dashboard. For example, the user could type, “What if I double the number
of runs per month?” The AI could then do a quick calculation behind the scenes (or instruct the app to
recalc) and answer, “If runs double to 200/month, time savings and cost would double, bringing net ROI
to $X.” This turns the static dashboard into an interactive planning tool. In MVP, we might pre-build a
couple of quick scenario buttons (like +10% volume, –10% cost) rather than full freeform chat – but
the architecture with Azure OpenAI’s Responses API could support natural language Q&A over the
data.
```
```
Guidance Agents: We could include a small helper AI that, when you hover or click a module’s “AI
tip” icon, explains that metric in plain English. For instance, clicking on the Time Savings module’s AI
tip might produce a tooltip or chat bubble: “Time Value is calculated as hours saved per month
multiplied by hourly wage and a task value factor. Here, that equals 33.3 × $30 × 2.1 = ~$2,100 .”
```

```

```
Explaining the math builds trust and understanding for the user. This is especially important if the
user will share the results – they should be able to defend how the numbers came to be.
```
Technically, implementing these AI features means sending the relevant data (the ROI numbers, and
possibly the earlier Q&A context) to the OpenAI API with prompt templates. Azure’s new Responses API is
suited for multi-turn conversations and could even integrate function calls (for performing calculations or
retrieving specific data). For MVP, we can keep it straightforward: the front-end calls our Azure OpenAI
endpoint with a prompt like _“The user’s automation saves X hours at Y cost, etc. Provide a brief insight.”_ The
response is then displayed in the UI.

**Modularity & Extensibility:** The use of a Notion-like block system means down the line, we could let users
create custom modules or embed external content (imagine embedding a Notion page or a chart from
another tool). At MVP, focusing on our core ROI blocks is sufficient, but we’ll keep the system flexible.
Storing the layout configuration (which modules are present and their order) in local storage (IndexedDB)
means the user’s dashboard state will persist between sessions. This is important – an ops manager might
set up a dashboard for “Project X Automation ROI” and want to revisit it or show it later without re-entering
everything.

In summary, the ROI dashboard page is where **data meets presentation**. It should impress the user with
how organized and customizable the information is. Unlike a static ROI calculator that just spits out a
number, this dynamic dashboard feels like a living document that the user controls. It also differentiates the
product – even Notion itself doesn’t calculate ROI, and traditional automation tools don’t give this kind of
modular analysis view.

## 4. Smart ROI Estimation Methods with AI

A crucial behind-the-scenes aspect of our app is how it uses AI to **intelligently estimate or default values**
for ROI, given that users might have limited data. We leverage OpenAI in a few ways here:

```
Dynamic Question Flow: The AI-powered questionnaire isn’t a rigid form – it can ask different
questions or sub-questions depending on responses. For example, if the user’s task type selection
indicates a certain industry, the AI might insert an extra question about compliance (for a finance
task, “Are there regulatory reports involved?” ). This dynamic branching is managed by the AI agent
which has context of the ROI framework and the user’s answers so far. Azure’s Responses API allows
maintaining conversation state easily, enabling follow-up questions that feel natural and specific.
This ensures the coverage of ROI factors is tailored to the scenario, not one-size-fits-all. It’s like an
expert consultant interviewing the user about the automation opportunity, ensuring nothing
important is missed.
```
```
Pre-trained Knowledge & Few-Shot Prompts: We can prime the AI agent with a bit of domain
knowledge. For instance, provide a few examples of common tasks and typical times or values: “Data
entry – usually 5 minutes per item; Email follow-up – 2 minutes per email; Lead conversion – ~5%,” etc.
Then when the user describes a task, the AI can draw on that to guess a value if the user is unsure.
By keeping this knowledge base small and focused (either in the prompt or as hardcoded hints), we
avoid overloading the AI but give it just enough to make educated suggestions. Essentially, the AI
does a first pass of ROI calculation with “minimal structured data” – just the user’s answers and some
reference heuristics – to fill any gaps.
```
### •

### •


```
Natural Language to Numbers: If the user input is textual (e.g., they write “It takes a few hours to do
this manually” ), the AI can parse that into a number (maybe “a few hours” -> ~3 hours). Or if a user
describes the process instead of giving a number, the AI could extract the needed info. Example:
User says “We have to read 50 emails and make 10 updates daily” – the AI can infer runs per month =
(50/day * 30 days) or something and ask for confirmation. This is where using the AI’s language
understanding capabilities makes the tool more forgiving of how users provide input.
```
```
ROI Calculation Verification: Once the numbers are in, we can have the AI double-check the math
and outcome qualitatively. For instance, if the net ROI seems too high or low, the AI might flag it. The
AI could reason: “You’re saying 300 hires at $800 each – that’s $240k new revenue, which dominates the
ROI. This looks unusually high – is that correct?” (like in the case study, the revenue uplift was
indeed massive). This kind of reasoning ensures that outlier values get a second look, either to catch
user input errors or to prepare the user to explain such a result. Essentially, the AI can act as a sanity
check and an explanation engine.
```
```
Minimal Data Mode: If a user really has very little information (a scenario many consultants face
early on), our app could still provide a “rough ROI estimate” by asking just one or two high-level
questions and letting the AI assume the rest. For example, a mode where the user just says: “I spend
about 5 hours a week on invoice data entry.” The AI might combine that with default wage and value
multiplier to output: “Okay, roughly you’d save ~$X per month.” This quick estimate mode can hook the
user’s interest; then they can dive into the detailed questionnaire for refinement. The OpenAI model
can handle this summarization task by internally filling missing pieces with defaults. (In effect, this is
like a “fast ROI” feature using AI to cut corners, balancing accuracy and speed).
```
All these AI-driven methods underscore the app’s positioning: **not just a calculator, but a smart assistant
for ROI analysis**. By offloading estimation to an AI, we reduce the work on the user’s side – they don’t need
to hunt for data as much, and they get guidance at every step.

From a technical standpoint, these capabilities require carefully crafted prompts and perhaps some custom
functions. Azure’s Responses API (being stateful and allowing tool integration) is ideal. We might define a
function for doing arithmetic or lookup (for pricing data), and let the AI call it via the API if needed. For MVP,
a simpler approach is to do computations in the app code (once numbers are obtained) and just feed
results back to AI for explanation.

Security and performance are also considerations: all AI calls would use Azure endpoints with our
credentials. We should not expose the API key on the client – likely we will need a lightweight backend
component (or Next.js API route) to proxy these requests securely. This is a small exception to “no backend
logic”: it’s not persistence or business logic, just a secure relay for AI. The latency of AI responses should be
manageable (a few seconds). We can use loading spinners or have the chatbot persona use typing
indicators to feel interactive.

## 5. Tech Stack & Architecture

The app will be built with **React 18/19 and Next.js** , leveraging modern front-end capabilities. Using Next.js
provides a structured framework for our multi-page flow (each major stage can be a Next page or route)
and lets us easily integrate the needed libraries (shadcn/ui, Dexie, etc.).

### •

### •

```
23 24
```
### •


Key aspects of the architecture and tools:

```
UI Components (shadcn/ui + Tailwind): shadcn/ui is a collection of pre-built React components
styled with Tailwind CSS. This gives us accessible, themeable building blocks (buttons, dialogs, form
inputs, accordions, etc.) out of the box. We’ll use these to maintain a consistent look and feel. For
example, the chat bubbles on page 1, the toggle switches or dropdowns for form inputs, and the
cards for dashboard modules can all be composed from shadcn’s primitives (which are based on
Radix UI for accessibility). Tailwind will make it easy to apply our custom styling (like pixelated effects
or retro fonts if we choose) globally or to specific components.
```
```
State Management: We have to pass user data from the questionnaire to the builder to the
dashboard. Since we are not using a backend DB at this stage, IndexedDB via Dexie will serve as
our client-side database. Dexie provides a nice API for storing structured data in the browser that
persists across page reloads. We can create Dexie tables like AutomationScenario with fields for
all ROI inputs (T, H, etc.), maybe a JSON of the workflow structure, and the results. When the user is
answering questions, we store values as they come. When moving to the canvas, we store any
changes (like nodes added). Finally, the dashboard reads the stored data to display metrics. This
ensures if the user refreshes or comes back later, their work isn’t lost – a crucial feature for an MVP
trying to earn user trust.
```
```
Next.js Routing: Each page (questionnaire, canvas, dashboard) can be a route (e.g. /start, /
build , /roi ). Next.js will handle code-splitting so we don’t load all the heavy canvas code upfront.
This improves initial load speed for the landing page. Also, if we later want to allow multiple projects,
we could use dynamic routes (like /roi/[projectId]). For now, one scenario at a time is fine, but
we’ll code with potential multi-scenario support in mind (Dexie could hold multiple scenario records).
```
```
Visual Canvas Implementation: We will likely integrate React Flow for the node editor canvas.
React Flow is a proven library for node-based UIs, offering features like draggable nodes, zoom/pan,
and edge drawing out of the box. It’s also quite customizable – we can define custom node types to
incorporate our pixel-art styling or to embed small icons. Using React Flow prevents us from
reinventing the wheel in terms of hit-testing for connections, etc. The node data (like type, position,
connections) can be stored in Dexie as part of the scenario. When the Build page loads, we initialize
the React Flow graph from that data. User actions on the canvas (adding a node, connecting nodes)
update the Dexie store (either in real-time or on save). This way, the dashboard could even
potentially read some info from the workflow if needed (e.g., counting nodes of a certain type for
advanced suggestions).
```
```
Local Calculations vs API: The ROI formula itself (multiplying T H V*, adding R+U, subtracting C) is
straightforward arithmetic. We will implement that in plain JavaScript – likely whenever inputs
change, we re-calc the summary. This can be done either on the fly or at least once before showing
the dashboard. There’s no need to call the AI for the math, only for generating explanatory text or
suggestions. This keeps us efficient and ensures numbers are exact (AI’s numeric reasoning, while
good, can sometimes be slightly off; we prefer determinism for the core calculations).
```
```
Azure OpenAI Integration: For integrating with the Azure-hosted OpenAI service, we have a couple
of options:
```
### •

```
Direct vs Server Proxy: If we call the OpenAI API directly from the client, we’d expose the API key,
which is not secure. Instead, we should set up a minimal Next.js API route (serverless function) that
the client can send a request to (with the prompt or conversation) and that server route will call
Azure OpenAI using the key stored securely on the server side. This keeps our key hidden. The
serverless function can also enforce any length limits or moderate content if needed. The slight
overhead is worth the security.
```
```
Responses API Usage: Azure’s Responses API (in preview) is designed for orchestrating
conversations with tools. We might not need its full power for MVP, but it could help manage dialog
flow in the questionnaire. We could define an “assistant” with certain tools (like a function for
retrieving benchmark data from a small static list). However, even using standard ChatCompletion
with a system prompt defining the ROI framework could suffice. We will test both and choose what
provides more consistency. The key is that the AI should maintain context across multiple questions
which the Azure chat endpoint handles well (we just send the conversation history).
```
```
Performance Considerations: All heavy lifting (AI calls, React Flow rendering) happens on the client
side or via quick API proxies. The dataset (one automation’s info) is small, so Dexie queries are near
instant. The canvas could have dozens of nodes at most in typical use; React Flow can handle that
easily. We should lazy-load the canvas component – using Next’s dynamic import for the builder
page – so that we don’t load it until user actually reaches it. This way someone coming just to try the
questionnaire isn’t forced to load the flow editor code. Similarly, we could lazy-load any chart
libraries on the dashboard only if needed.
```
```
Browser Compatibility and Offline: Since it’s all in-browser with no required backend (except AI
calls), the app could theoretically function offline up until the point of needing AI. We might consider
caching some AI responses or allowing the app to still display last known ROI if offline. But primary
use will assume connectivity (especially for AI). We should test in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, Edge) as our stack is pretty standard React/JS.
```
Given no backend persistence, if a user opens the app on a different device, they’d have to re-enter info
(unless we implement an export/import of scenario data or eventually a login system). That’s acceptable for
an MVP. We focus on making the single-device experience robust first.

```
Security and Privacy: User data (like process details or ROI numbers) stays in their browser storage.
If they use the AI features, some of that data will be sent to our Azure OpenAI instance. We should
be transparent about this (in a privacy note) and ensure no highly sensitive data is being asked (the
user persona is dealing with business processes, which should be fine). We won’t integrate any third-
party analytics or trackers at MVP to keep it simple and private.
```
```
Pricing Data Handling: Since we rely on standard pricing for tools, we’ll likely hardcode or maintain
a small JSON of pricing info (e.g. Zapier plan costs, OpenAI token costs, etc.). The AI could also have
this info if needed to explain costs. There’s no need for scraping external pricing at this stage – that
reduces complexity and avoids scraping policy issues. Instead, maybe a manual annual update of
those values in the app is enough.
```
### • • • • • •


In essence, the architecture is a **client-centric SPA** with a few server-assisted calls for AI. This aligns well
with MVP: minimal infrastructure and mostly front-end development. It also means easier deployment (just
a static site or Vercel app, plus Azure AI service credentials).

## 6. Competitive Landscape & Differentiators

To ensure our product stands out, we’ve looked at what others offer and how we can differentiate:

```
Zapier: As noted, Zapier has introduced an ROI-oriented feature in its analytics for enterprise users –
essentially showing time saved based on a fixed “2 minutes per task” assumption. This is a very
broad-brush approach to ROI. Our tool is far more customizable and granular: we consider different
task types (via V multiplier), risk, and revenue, not just time saved. Moreover, Zapier’s ROI stat is buried in
analytics; it’s not an interactive planner. We offer a standalone, interactive ROI tool * that consultants can
use even before implementing anything (Zapier’s works after you’ve automated and counts tasks).
So we serve the “pre-implementation justification” phase, which is huge for pitching automation
projects.
```
```
RPA Vendors (e.g. Fortra, UiPath): Many RPA companies provide ROI calculators or case studies.
Fortra’s online calculator, for example, asks for some basic inputs and then estimates savings and
payback period. However, these are usually static web forms with a simple result, and often only
cover labor reduction. Our MVP builds on that concept but integrates it with a workflow design tool
and AI chat. This creates a seamless experience from idea to result, whereas a generic ROI form is
isolated. Also, RPA calculators may assume you know all your numbers up front; our AI helps you
figure them out.
```
```
Notion / Spreadsheet DIY: The status quo for many consultants is to use spreadsheets or Notion
docs to present ROI analyses. Notion pages can be flexible but any calculations are manual, and
spreadsheets can calculate but are not interactive or engaging in presentation. Our product marries
the two: calculations + document-style presentation in one app, plus the ability to simulate the
actual automation. It saves users from juggling multiple tools (one to design the automation,
another to calculate ROI, another to write a report).
```
```
Other Automation Platforms (Make, n8n, Workato, etc.): To our knowledge, none of these
provide an integrated ROI calculator for general use. They focus on building and running workflows.
Workato’s documentation urges users to calculate ROI by comparing costs and savings manually
```
- underscoring that many find ROI hard to quantify. In fact, it’s known that _a large portion of
organizations struggle to justify automation ROI internally_ , which is exactly the pain point we address.
By being perhaps the **first tool to tightly link workflow creation with ROI justification** , we have a
strong unique value proposition.

```
Design & Theme: The “pixelated RPG” design angle is unique in this space. Most business software,
especially for workflow automation, has a very polished, corporate feel. By contrast, our playful
aesthetic can make the experience more approachable and memorable. It’s a calculated risk – we’ll
ensure it’s not overdone such that it looks unprofessional. But touches like a pixel art mascot, or
node icons that look like game items, can delight users and even make demos to stakeholders more
fun. (Imagine a consultant showing a board room an ROI tool that looks like a game – it could be an
ice breaker while still delivering serious info.)

AI-first Approach: We leverage AI not as a gimmick but as an integral part of the UX. From guiding
input to analyzing output, the AI is like a consultant alongside the user. Competitors might use AI for
some recommendations (e.g., Workato has some AI features in integration building, and Typeform’s
Formless uses AI for forms). But our integration of AI in an ROI context – e.g., auto-estimating
values, explaining results – is cutting-edge. It turns what could be a dull form into an engaging
conversation and an insightful report. This level of guidance is a differentiator, especially at MVP
stage where others haven’t implemented it yet.
```
```
No-Code and MVP Simplicity: Our solution requires no coding or complex setup from the user. In
MVP form, it’s a lightweight web app – no need to connect actual accounts or data. This lowers the
barrier to try it out. A freelancer or manager can go to the site and within minutes get a tailored ROI
report for an automation idea. This speed from zero to insight is a key selling point.
```
In conclusion, this MVP design brings together best practices from multiple domains: conversational UI for
data collection , visual node-based process design , and flexible dashboarding – all enhanced
by AI. The research and references show that each piece of our concept is grounded in a trend or need (be it
Zapier’s flowcharts, Notion’s modular pages, or the push for ROI transparency in automation ). By
combining them, we create a product experience greater than the sum of parts: a tool that doesn’t just
calculate ROI, but helps **craft the story of ROI** for automation projects in an interactive, user-friendly way.
