- [ ] Ensure state persistence across sessions

## Data Mining 1-2hrs
        - Jake is finding overlapping apps
- [ ] Basic app info for apps that are in make,n8n and zapier. (check current DB for apps to cross-reference)
- [ ] Find price formulas for make, n8n and zapier.

## Automation Template Collection & Semantic Search 2-3hrs
- [x] Design and document `AutomationTemplate` schema (`backend/automationTemplateSchema.ts`).
